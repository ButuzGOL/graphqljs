# GraphQL JS

A simple [GraphQL](https://gist.github.com/wincent/598fa75e22bdfa44cf470) parser written in JavaScript.

### Usage

After cloning, install deps with `npm install`.

You can re-build the parser by running `npm run build`

Or see a demo of its output by running `npm run demo`, this runs the parser over `./examples/friends.gql` and dumps the parsed object to the console.
